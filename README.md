An old project I made with the help of my mentors. This project is really basic in design, but is more complicated than it seems. I used Redux to manage state, wrote tests for the components, styled with sass, and did my best to match the project structure to larger projects. It's not perfect, but it shows some of what I can do.

The SpaceX Launches API was the favorite in the office for personal projects. It is well documented, and easy to use.

I found the best way to run it locally now is to use node version 9.10.0. It is also hosted on https://sxv2721.github.io/SpaceX-Launches-App/
